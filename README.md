A raytraced 3D graphing utility that aims to have incredible flexibility.

This project was inspired by my Calculus 3 class, where I often had to visualize the shape of a 3D function to solve a problem. However, there are not very many online 3D graphing utilities, and those that exist often require the function to be solved for z. 

So, I came up with a rendering engine that could graph nearly any equation imaginable, and run in a web browser. This application can handle any equation, whether it is solved for z or not. In addition, it can handle polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, spherical coordinates, or some strange mix of all of them.

I hope this program can be of use to other math students or anyone else who needs a graph.
